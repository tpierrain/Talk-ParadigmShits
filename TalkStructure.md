# Structure of our talk

(Where we draft the structure of our talk)

Inspired by Nancy DUARTE recommendations (see. [Resonate](http://resonate.duarte.com/)), we will work on the structure of our talk:
 - What is the problem?
 - What is the call for action?
 - What is the tipping point for the audience?
 
Once we will have diverged a lot (see [BrainsDump.md](BrainsDump.md)), the idea is to work then on a __sparkline__ like the one below before we start to produce any slide:
 
![sparklineSample](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CziiBeOXUAAMrcO.jpg:large)

here:
  - 0 (level) means __"what is"__ 
  - 10 (level) means __"what may be"__
  - The sparkline ends with the __call for action__.
  
  *Note: 0 and 10 are completely arbitrary here (I should had made them disappear on the diagram)*
