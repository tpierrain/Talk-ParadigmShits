# Structure of our talk

Inspired by Nancy DUARTE recommendations (see. Resonate), we will work on the structure of our talk:
 - What is the problem?
 - What is the call for action?
 - What is the tipping point for the audience?
 
 The idea is to work on a sparkline like this (below) before we start to produce any slide:

here:
  - 0 (level) means __"what is"__ 
  - 10 (level) means __"what may be"__
  - The sparkline ends with the __call for action__.
